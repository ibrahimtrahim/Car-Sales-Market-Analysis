## Business Problem:

Our dealership group faced challenges in identifying the **best cars to stock for resale**. With multiple manufacturers, models, and varying features (engine, fuel type, mileage, year), pricing cars competitively while ensuring profitability was complex.

## The Solution:

Using Excel, we analyzed a dataset of car sales to uncover **market trends, price drivers, and depreciation patterns**. 
We built an **interactive dashboard** to track sales, average resale values, and demand by manufacturer, model, and fuel type.

## Dashboard

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Standardized manufacturer and model names.
- Handled missing values (mileage, price).
- Created derived metrics: Age of car, Price per km, Profitability Index.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- PivotTables for sales by manufacturer, fuel type, year.
- Correlation analysis of mileage, engine size, and sale price.
- Trend analysis of resale value over years of manufacture.
3. Dashboard Creation
- KPIs: Average Price, Total Cars Sold, Avg Mileage.
- Slicers for Manufacturer, Fuel Type, Year.
- Visuals: Line charts (trends), Bar charts (top models), Scatter plots (price vs mileage), Pie charts (fuel type distribution).

## Key Insights from Car Sales Analysis
1. Top Manufacturers
- Toyota, Ford, and Volkswagen (VW) dominate the resale market.
- These brands together represent the majority of transactions, making them strategic to stock in dealerships.
2. Top Models
